# Console news on consoles
Check the most recent console jailbreaking news

## To open the news webpage:
### On PSVita or newer (or on any other non-PlayStation device):
Just come to this webpage: https://edw590.github.io/Console-news-on-consoles/ (I think all newer than PS3 devices are supposed to be able to load the page normally).

### On PS3:
#### For HAN, HEN or CFW:
- Use Console news on consoles installer for HEN and CFW --> NOT READY YET.
#### For HAN (or CFW):
- Install HAN Toolbox 0.9 Unofficial or newer (https://github.com/DADi590/HAN-Toolbox-Unofficial/releases), which comes with What's New on Browser which shows the PSX-Place/PS3 page.

### On PSP:
Not available (yet?).

### On PS1 or PS2:
How is this supposed to go on consoles which don't have a browser? XD
